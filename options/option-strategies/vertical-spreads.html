  <h2>Vertical Options Strategies</h2>
  <p style="max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;">
    Vertical spread strategies involve simultaneously buying and selling options of the same underlying asset with the same expiration date but different strike prices. They can be used to limit risk, reduce cost, and generate income depending on market outlook.

    <p>This strategy is formed by buying a call option with a strike price of $315 and selling another call with a higher strike price of $325, as shown in the table below.</p>
    <p>The net cost of the strategy is <strong>$4.50</strong> per share (paid debit), calculated as the premium paid for buying the call ($8.00) minus the premium received from selling the call ($3.50). Based on that, the breakeven price at expiration is <strong>$319.50</strong>, calculated as the strike price of the long call ($315) plus the net debit paid.  
    The maximum profit is capped at <strong>$5.50</strong> per share, which is the difference between the strike prices ($10.00) minus the net debit paid. Maximum loss equals the net debit paid ($4.50).</p>
